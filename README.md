movewin.vim
=====

This Vim plugin was forked from  
  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=741    

Move GUI window using the keyboard, for those who don't like to use the mouse.  
After loading the script, call :MoveWin.  Use hjkl and shift+hjkl keys to move the window, press any other key when done.  
The original plugin could be used in GUI only. But this forked plugin can be used in Windows-CUI (Command-Prompt) also.  
In addition, comparing with the original plugin, there is a small difference.
